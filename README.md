# Air_Traffic_Analysis

Introduction:

This project focuses on analysing air traffic data to find important trends, passenger flow patterns, and how activity is spread across different regions. Understanding how air traffic moves and what factors affect it is very important for making better decisions in the aviation sector. It helps improve operations, passenger experience, and how resources are used. By carefully studying the given air traffic data, this project aims to provide insights that can help solve current challenges and support smarter planning.

This report aims to explore and analyse the dataset on Flights. Let's delve into the details:
1. Data Overview:
   
•	The dataset consists of information about different Air Traffic Activity.

•	The dataset includes several key columns: Activity Period, which represents the time (year and month) of the recorded activity; Operating Airline, which identifies the airline; GEO Summary and GEO Region, detailing the flight’s origin or destination region; Activity Type Code, which shows whether passengers are arriving (Deplaned), departing (Enplaned), or in transit; Terminal and Boarding Area, which specify where the activity took place within the airport; and Passenger Count, which records the number of passengers involved in each activity.


2. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
   
The Air Traffic data was loaded from a CSV file using pandas. Libraries like NumPy and warnings were imported for numerical operations and handling warnings, respectively. seaborn, and matplotlib were used for data visualization.
Data cleaning steps included:

•	Handling missing values by replacing 'na' with NaN.

•	Replaced all occurrences of 'na', 'N/A', and blank entries with np.nan for proper handling.

•	The Activity Period column, which stores the time in a string format, was converted into a datetime format using pd.to_datetime().


3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   
•	Dataframe information and dtypes were explored using df.info() and df.dtypes.

•	Column names were retrieved using df.columns to understand the scope and variables available for analysis.

•	Missing values were assessed using df.isnull().sum() to identify columns with incomplete data.

•	Descriptive Statistics: Use data.describe() to get an overview of numerical columns, including passenger counts.

•	Aggregating Data by Region: Group by GEORegion and GEOSummary to find total passenger traffic for each region.

•	Aggregating by Activity Type: Group the data by Activity Type Code and sum the passenger counts for each activity type.


4.  Temporal Analysis
   
•	groupby() or pivot_table() is used to group the data by year and month.

•	Compare traffic data across the same months each year to spot changes in passenger flow.


5.  Airline Analysis
   
•	identify the airlines with the highest and lowest number of passengers, we can group the data by Operating Airline and sum the Passenger Count for each airline. 

•	This will help in understanding the proportion of passengers each airline handles compared to the others.


6.  Airline Analysis
   
•	Use groupby() to group the data by Terminal and Boarding Area. Sum the Passenger Count for each group to determine the busiest terminals and boarding areas.

•	groupby() is used to calculate the Passenger Count for each terminal or boarding area.


7. Data Visualizations
   
•	Histograms: Used to show the distribution of Passenger Count across the dataset, helping to detect skewness, outliers, or concentration of values.

•	Box Plots: Used to detect outliers and visualize the spread of passenger counts across different groups (such as by region or activity type).

•	Line Graphs: Used to show how passenger traffic changes over months and years, helping to visualize trends, peaks, and dips over time.

•	Heatmaps: Used to visualize month-wise passenger traffic, where darker colors represent higher passenger numbers.

•	Bar Plots: Used to compare the total number of passengers handled by different airlines.



Conclusion:

•	The air traffic data was successfully analyzed to uncover trends, patterns of passenger flow, and regional activity distribution.

•	The busiest airlines and regions were identified, helping highlight major hubs of air traffic activity.

•	Temporal analysis revealed clear seasonal trends, with certain months showing peak and low passenger traffic, aiding in predicting high-demand periods.

•	Year-over-year analysis showed growth trends and fluctuations in passenger numbers, useful for long-term strategic planning.

•	Terminal and boarding area analysis pinpointed the locations with the highest passenger traffic, providing insights for better resource management at airports.

This report provides Overall, the project provided actionable insights to enhance operational efficiency, optimize resource allocation, and improve passenger experience in the aviation sector.
